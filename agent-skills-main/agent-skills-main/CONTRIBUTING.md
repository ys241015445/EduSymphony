# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thank you for contributing to Supabase Agent Skills! Here's how to get started:

[1. Getting Started](#getting-started) | [2. Issues](#issues) |
[3. Pull Requests](#pull-requests) | [4. Contributing New References](#contributing-new-references) |
[5. Creating a New Skill](#creating-a-new-skill)

## Getting Started

To ensure a positive and inclusive environment, please read our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/supabase/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
before contributing.

### Setup

This project uses `pnpm` for dependency management and task execution. Use the
Node.js version declared in [`.node-version`](/Users/pedrorodrigues/supabase-agent-skills/.node-version),
then run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install        # Install all npm dependencies
```

## Issues

If you find a typo, have a suggestion for a new skill/reference, or want to improve
existing skills/references, please create an Issue.

- Please search
  [existing Issues](https://github.com/supabase/agent-skills/issues) before
  creating a new one.
- Please include a clear description of the problem or suggestion.
- Tag your issue appropriately (e.g., `bug`, `question`, `enhancement`,
  `new-reference`, `new-skill`, `documentation`).

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your Pull Requests! Here's what to keep in mind:

- If you're fixing an Issue, make sure someone else hasn't already created a PR
  for it. Link your PR to the related Issue(s).
- We will always try to accept the first viable PR that resolves the Issue.
- If you're new, we encourage you to take a look at issues tagged with
  [good first issue](https://github.com/supabase/agent-skills/labels/good%20first%20issue).
- If you're proposing a significant new skill or major changes, please open a
  [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/new/choose) first to
  gather feedback before investing time in implementation.

### Pre-Flight Checks

Before submitting your PR, make sure you have the right tooling and run these
checks:

```bash
pnpm test         # Run the test suite
```

All commands must complete successfully.

### Releases

This repository uses Release Please to manage semantic version releases.

- Use conventional commit prefixes such as `feat:` and `fix:` in merge commits so Release Please can determine the next version.
- Release Please opens a release PR on `main` with the version bump and changelog updates.
- When that release PR is merged, GitHub Actions publishes a GitHub release and uploads one `.tar.gz` artifact per shipped skill.
- Those releases are consumed by downstream repositories, including the Supabase plugin repo, so they are part of the supported maintainer workflow. Downstream consumers are expected to poll these releases rather than rely on a cross-repo dispatch from this repository.

If your PR changes shipped skill content, assume it is release-affecting and make sure the resulting merge commit uses the right conventional commit type.

## Contributing New References

To add a reference to an existing skill:

1. Navigate to `skills/{skill-name}/references/`
2. Copy `_template.md` to `{prefix}-{your-reference-name}.md`
3. Fill in the frontmatter (title, impact, tags)
4. Write explanation and examples (Incorrect/Correct)
5. Bump the `version` in the skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter metadata
6. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

## Creating a New Skill

Skills follow the [Agent Skills Open Standard](https://agentskills.io/).

### 1. Create the directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p skills/my-skill/references
```

### 2. Create SKILL.md

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it.
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: your-org
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# My Skill

Instructions for agents using this skill.

## References

- https://example.com/docs
```

### 3. Create references/_sections.md

```markdown
## 1. First Category (first)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Description:** What this category covers.

## 2. Second Category (second)
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** What this category covers.
```

### 4. Create reference files

Name files as `{prefix}-{reference-name}.md` where prefix matches a section.

Example: `first-example-reference.md` for section "First Category"
